This is a MUI custom class package containing replacements for the
List/Listtree/Listviews/Floattext/Bitmap/Balance MUI built-in classes.

Horizontal scrolling is fully supported, as well as smooth scrolling,
word wrap, clipboard support, the classic char selection possibility,
drag & drop and many other features. The user can change the column
width with the mouse, and column titles can act as buttons.

A NListviews.mcp prefs class is included, allowing the user to change
backgrounds, pens, fonts, scrollbars mode, drag & drop mode, multiselect
mode, keys, qualifiers and more.

Also included is a Floattext.mui replacement that uses NFloattext.mcc,
enabling copy to clipboard and key moving.

The 'NList'-package includes the following MCC classes:

* NList.mcc – List.mui replacement class
* NListview.mcc – Listview.mui replacement class
* NFloattext.mcc – Floattext.mui replacement class
* NListtree.mcc – Listtree.mcc replacement class
* NBitmap.mcc – Bitmap.mui replacement class
* NBalance.mcc – Balance.mui replacement class
* NListviews.mcp – Preference class for NListview.mcc
* NListtree.mcp – Preference class for NListtree.mcc

NList MUI Classes are available for AmigaOS3, AmigaOS4, MorphOS and AROS.

   ```

2. Go to the `MCC_NList/Libs/MUI/<OS>` directory where `<OS>` is the directory
   matching the operating system you want to install NList for:
   ```
   > cd MCC_NList/Libs/MUI/AmigaOS4
   ```

3. copy all `#?.mcc` and `#?.mcp` files found in that `<OS>` directory to the
   global `MUI:Libs/mui/` directory on your system partition:
   ```
   > copy #?.mcc MUI:Libs/mui/
   > copy #?.mcp MUI:Libs/mui/
   ```
